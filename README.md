# Feed Reader Testing - FEND Nanodegree Project
Version 1.0 1/31/2017

## Project Overview

In this project Udacity provided a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application saw the value in testing, they already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite. For this project I was required to complete the testing suites, ensure that they are comprehensive enough to adequately test the functionality of the application.

## To run the application

Download the files from this repository to your computer and run the index.html file in your web browser.
